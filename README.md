# JavaScript
***A live coding session on TDD and implementing FizzBuzz*** :+1:

### TDD
* Red
* Green
* Refactor
* Cycle to fail, pass & refactor your tests
* Test coverate shall be high

### Justifying TDD
* No reckless development!
* JS is growing and 1st class language
* Code quality
* Why TDD in JS?

### JavaScript TDD tools

**KARMA**
- Is a test runner
- Node *npm* pacakge
- Command line tool
- Run tests at various browsers

**JASMINE**
- Test suite
- Define specifications using *describe()* function
- Write test cases using *it()* function
- Assert using *expect()* function
- Matchers like 
  * toEqual()
  * toBe()
  * toMatch()
  * ...


**ISTANBUL**
- Code coverage tool
- Command line package to generate report

**OTHER TOOLS**
- Gulp
- Grunt
- Mocha
- Chai
- ...

###SETUP BASIC WEB APP
* Initialize *npm* config
* Install various packages
  * npm install karma --save-dev
  * npm install jasmine-core --save-dev
  * npm install karma-jasmine --save-dev
  * npm install karma-chrome-launcher --save-dev
  
* Initialize *karma* config
* Test *karma start*
* Create directories as *app* & *test*
* Write your 1st Unit test
* fail-pass
* JASMINE framework
* KARMA file : Convention over Code

###FIZZ BUZZ

```Fizz buzz is a group word game for children to teach them about division.[1] Players take turns to count incrementally, replacing any number divisible by three with the word "fizz", and any number divisible by five with the word "buzz"```
*- by Wikipedia*
* Print numbers from 1 to 100
* Print "Fizz" instead of the number that is divisible by 3
* Print "Buzz" instead of the number that is divisible by 5
* Print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number that is divisible by both 3 and 5
